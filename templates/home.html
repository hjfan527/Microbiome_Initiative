                <p>Welcome to the Boston University Microbiome Initiative. We bring together scientists from different disciplines and departments,
                with a common interest in microbial ecosystems. Our research spans multiple scales and levels of complexity,
                with applications in global change, metabolic engineering and biomedicine. The BU Microbiome Initiative is
                a collaborative project focused on studying the bacterial interactions within the human microbiome.</p>
